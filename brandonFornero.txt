Howdy! My name is Brandon Fornero. I'm starting my senior year as a Computer
Science student at Texas A&M in the Fall. Outside of software engineering, I love
sports, music, and space. My favorite programming language is Python because
I'm very interested in machine learning, however I have been spending a lot of time
learning Zig recently. Lastly, I love neovim as my text editor!
